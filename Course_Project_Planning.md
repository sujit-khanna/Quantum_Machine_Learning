# Quantum Computing Course Final Project: Quantum ML
## Course of Action for the project:
    1. Implement Quantum classification algorithms and test it's performance
    2. Pro's and Cons's of approach, and assessing areas for potential quantum advantage
    3. Implement on a toy set and a real-world dataset
    4. First implementation on a simulator and the second one on actual hardware
    5. Next steps as a research direction and potential issues and benefits
    
## Quantum Classification Models:
    1. Quantum SVM as an initial baseline (binary or multiclass dataset)
    2. Quantum Neural network with one qubit (starting point)
    3. Quantum Neural network with multiple enangled qubits (deep network) *** super important ***
    4. Play around with quantum CNN with quantum convolutional layer trained (quantum automatic differentiation)
    5. Quantum Graph RNN (GGRNN) for optial control (execution problems)
    
## Using the pennylane plugin for IBM Q hardware backend
    1. create a framework to integrate IBM Q hardware with pennylane. *** super important for longterm advantage ***
